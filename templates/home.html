  First of all I welcome you and hope you are doing great. The motive of this website is to provide you with the modern templates being used and coding question which are mostly not standard from different resources.
  In the Templates section I have provided Links to various templates like Disjoint Set Union , Segment Tree , Lowest Common Ancestor , Prime Number Finder , Djikstra shortest path , Prims minimum spanning tree.

  In the <strong>Starters</strong> section I have provided topics which are required for the basic understanding of code flow. Brain sharpeners include simple short thinking problem to increase the thinking process.
  In the <strong>Intermediate</strong> section the topics included are mostly based on the implementation and variety of use of various data structures like vector , stacks , sets , hashmaps , pair etc.
  In the <strong>Advance</strong> section the topics are mostly focused on learning some advance ways to solve and visualize the problems. These are sometimes confusing but always interesting to solve!
      
      I have tried my best to arrange the problems in the <strong>increasing</strong> order of difficulty. Always remember that if you are stuck in some problem or solved a problem forcefully please look into others people submission you will definetily learn to code more efficiently.

  Myself <strong>Gaurav Singh</strong> from Uttar Pradesh and I am currently pursuing my undergraduate at <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong> from Material Science and Engineering department :). From these you have now understand that I am not much involved towards my department as it is more research oriented :). 
  My Codeforces profile is <a href = "https://codeforces.com/profile/Sangamer" target = "_blank">Sangamer.</a> I have started my coding journey in 2021 but at a very slow pace but I never left it because I love to see that green Accepted button.
